# Balena To Do List

This is a Flask based To Do List web application designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 using [balena](https://www.balena.io/).  This project was undertaken as a personal project and a tool to learn how to develop Flask based web applications.  

Other more functional to do list software is available for free online such as [Trello](https://trello.com/).

This project creates a web application on the Raspberry Pi, and is designed to be used with an [official Pi Touchscreen](https://thepihut.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display) to create a desktop to do list.

Any ongoing maintenance and development will be undertaken at my leisure.
