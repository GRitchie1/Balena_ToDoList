# Balena To Do List

This is a Flask based To Do List web application designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 using [balena](https://www.balena.io/).  This project was undertaken as a personal project and a tool to learn how to develop Flask based web applications.  

Other more functional to do list software is available for free online such as [Trello](https://trello.com/).

This project creates a web application on the Raspberry Pi, and is designed to be used with an [official Pi Touchscreen](https://thepihut.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display) to create a desktop to do list.

Each item can have sub steps which can be marked complete and there is a button to select a random item from the list.  Items can be "snoozed" to stop them appearing in the random item selection, and each item counts how many times it have been snoozed (to give you the motivation to complete the task).  

There is also a tab which displays countdown timers to due date/times which can be set for each item.

Any ongoing maintenance and development will be undertaken at my leisure.
